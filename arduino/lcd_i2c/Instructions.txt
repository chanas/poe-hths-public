1.  Download the NewLiquidCrystal_1.5.1 zip file and i2c_scanner folder.
2.  Extract the zip file.
3.  Copy the "NewLiquidCrystal_lib" folder and paste it in your "...\Arduino\libraries" directory.
4.  Upload and run the i2C_scanner sketch to determine the i2C address.  
    This address will be used to map the pins on the LCD to the 4 pins on the i2C board and allow for 
    proper communication between the two.
5.  Turn on the Serial Monitor under Tools.  If everything is working properly, you should see text
    similar to:  "I2C device found at address 0x27  !"  (You're board's I2C address may be different).
