# Important Notes #

* This folder contains VEX parts that were not included as part of the Fusion 360 VEX 5 CAD Library zip file.
* All of the files here are in STEP format (this is standard CAD file format that you can upload into Fusion 360).
* If you don't have GitHub desktop installed on your computer, clone the entire repository, but select the download as a ZIP file option.  After the ZIP file has downloaded, extract it on your computer.  The files are now ready to be uploaded into Fusion.
* You'll need to upload the files individually (click the link below for a demo) so only upload the files you need to save space and time.
* [Uploading STEP File Demo](/vex-fusion-models-additional-parts/upload-stp-file-demo.gif)
* Pictures are also included so that you can see what the components look like.
